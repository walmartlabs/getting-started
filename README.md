Getting Started with the WalmartLabs API
========================================

So you want to have some fun with the WalmartLabs API in
Javascript or Node. Cool. Here is what you need to do.
First, you need to [get an API key](https://developer.walmartlabs.com/member)
if you don't have one already.

With that in hand you are all ready to dig in. If you're like
all, "just give me the API I got this", then just:

```
npm install walmart --save
```

In your project. You can find the [code in Github](https://github.com/walmartlabs/walmart-api)
with some docs, examples, tests and the usual such and such.

The APIs themselves are [documented on the WalmartLabs developer API site](https://developer.walmartlabs.com/docs). But it's not exactly rocket science; get an item, lookup by UPC, search, stores by GPS coordinate.
The usual suspects.

Now, if you are all like, "meh, I'd be cool with a starter project", then
we have three to suit:

* [Starting with Express](https://github.com/walmartlabs/express-example)
* [Starting with HAPI](https://github.com/walmartlabs/hapi-example)
* [Starting with Cordova](https://github.com/walmartlabs/cordova-starter-kit)

All of these examples are designed to be *bare bones*. We don't give you
CSS, or almost any JS beyond some very simple jQuery stuff. So you're not
going to have to hack away a lot of bloat-ware just to get to the three
lines you actually need.

Best of luck, friends. Stay frosty! If you need help you can
